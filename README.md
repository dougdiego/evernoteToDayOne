evernoteToDayOne
================

An AppleScript to export item(s) from Evernote to Day One.

This code was originally taken from the work done by Justin Lancy at:
http://veritrope.com/code/export-evernote-items-to-day-one/

I added the property:
property extractDateFromTitle : "OFF"

I organized all my Evernote entries by the title rather than create date.  I gave them a title like "20130718-notes".  When this property is set to "ON" the date is taken from the title instead of the create date.

Follow the link above for details on how to run the script.
